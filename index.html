	<p>Kith first opened its doors as a sneaker boutique in Lower Manhattan that quickly gained popularity amongst the style savvy. Four years ago founder Ronnie Fieg, 34, looked to capitalize off of the store’s popularity by launching KITH as a menswear brand, and later introduced a women’s line.</p>
	<p>Since then, the label has expanded to a Brooklyn flagship, and opened pop-up shops in cities like Miami, Los Angeles, Milan, and Paris. Tuesday night signaled a new era in the brand’s novel history with its very first runway show, dubbed Kithland.</p>       
	<p>The Kithland collection featured a trio of themes that define the Kith lifestyle within its massive array of clothing offerings: beach, city, and mountain. The beach collection featured summer-ready pieces like athletic shorts and sweatshirts, along with bathing suits and a bevy of accessories like beach towels. Fieg’s city collection encompassed the more refined streetwear looks aimed toward a night out, while the mountain collection was full of hefty outerwear and sportswear staple pieces.</p>
	<p>The audience was stocked with big-name celebrities like rapper Rick Ross, supermodels Bella Hadid and Jourdan Dunn, athletes Victor Cruz and Iman Shumpert, and Public School designers Maxwell Osborne and Dao Yi Chow.</p>
	<p>Fans of the brand will be pleased to know that Fieg also unveiled his entire roster of forthcoming collaborations in the show. Drawing from a range of influences, 2017 will see Kith collaborate with athletic brands Nike, adidas, Asics, and New Balance. </p>

	<p>Additionally, the brand has collections with Columbia Sportswear, streetwear favorite A Bathing Ape, and Bergdorf Goodman coming in 2017. The latter is in commemoration of Kith’s upcoming in-store shop at the luxury retailer’s 5th Avenue location.</p>
	<p>Kithland’s major underlying theme of the collection was the designer’s New York roots. This much was evident from his choice of performers between each seasonal collection. The show featured performances from New York rappers Fabolous, The Lox, Ma$e, Ja Rule, and A$AP Rocky. Fieg touts the ‘90s in New York as a major time in his life, and one that translates into his clothing.</p>
	<p>"The brand has always been an extension of myself," Fieg said in an interview with W Mag. "A lot of the opportunities to bring brands and styles back have stemmed from my past. This show is a summary of the brand and brings together everything to demonstrate what we’ve become."</p>
